# Predicting Full Load Electrical Output of a Combined Cycle Power Plant

This repository contains code and resources for predicting the full load electrical output of a combined cycle power plant using Polynomial Linear Regression. The project aims to provide accurate predictions of power plant output based on various operating parameters.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the electrical output of a combined cycle power plant under full load conditions. By analyzing historical data and using Polynomial Linear Regression, we aim to create a reliable model that can assist in optimizing power plant performance and energy production.

## Motivation
Accurate predictions of power plant output are essential for efficient operation and planning in the energy sector. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we can leverage historical data to build models that can estimate the electrical output based on input parameters. This can help power plant operators optimize their operations, forecast energy production, and make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and maintenance.
